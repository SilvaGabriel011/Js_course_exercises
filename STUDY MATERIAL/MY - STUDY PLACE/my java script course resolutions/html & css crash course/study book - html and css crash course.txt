    basics of html and css

    HTML structure AND elements
        index.html 
            name of the main file in any project
        html document
            made of elements using opening and closing tag
            the main element is 
                <html>
                    <head>
                    <title>
                    "learning HTML & css"
                    </title>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                    <h1>
                    TE MAIN TITLE OF THE PAGE
                        JS is fun but HMTL & CSS ARE ALSO FUN
                    </h1> 
                    <p>
                    a paragraph
                        jane doe does smoke jelly on doe's balcony
                    </p>
                    </body>
                </html>  
        the title is what we gona see in chrome
        the head is like the setting of the page
        the body shows whays will be visible on the page
        heading go to h1 to h6
            each h's will have different styles automatticaly aplied by the browser
        for DOM manipulation is good to have some basic ideas on HTML& CSS
        can put links and images on html with attibutes
        exclamation point and then tab
            <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html lang="en">
                <head>
                    <meta charset="UTF-8">
                    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                    <title>Document</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                    
                </body>
                </html>

    attributes, classes and ids 
        in html some elements can have attributes
            this attributes describes the element
        in the img we don have a closing tag
            it dosent has any write content
            so it will be like 
                <img src="url"/>
        DIFFERENT ELEMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES
            A(ELEMENT) = HREF(ATTRIBUTES)
            IMG(ELEMENT) = SCR(ATTRIBUTES)
        two attibutes that can be used in all of elements
        name elements to select them in css in order to style them
            classes
            <p class= "name-of-the-class">
            </p>
            id's
            <img class= "name-of-the-image"/>
                can also secure an attibute of that element scope-type
                <img class= "name of the image" src ="url"/>
            i'ts also used in Js when we do DOM manipulation
            the difference betwen classes and id's is that id's need to be different
                so, we can repeate the name of the class, but we cannot repeat the name of the id
        create a box in HTML
            <div id="name-of-the-box">

            </div>
        we can have more than one h's elements on the same page
            but only one title

        <input type="type-of-data"(bool, num, str...) placeholder="type your data">
            input also doesn't have closing tag

        <button>
            (for the button do somethin we would need some Js) 
            text that is inside of the buttom
        </button>

        <p>
        <a href= "url"> 
        inline element
        (link)
        hyperlink
        </a>
        </p>
      <img src="url"/>

    when we have an input and a button as elements we consider the block as a form
        in HTML when we have a form, as specified above
            we have an speccial element called form 
            its better descriptive of the content that is inside of the box 
            <form>
            </form>
    the div box is generic 
        its better to name acordingly
        has meaning and semantic
    
    basic styling with CSS
        used to style elements and to create a layout for the overal page
        the style is placed inside the <head> </head>
        <head>
            element selector 
                selec all elements of a certain type
                    body{css declarations}
                    body{
                        propertie: specified value
                        background-color:color(green,blue)
                        }
        </head>
        css requires an separete file
            style.css
            to conect we use link element
                <link href='name of the css file'rel='stylesheet'/>
        inside the file we take the body{} from the html and styl√ße from it
        so...
            inside the css file
            when we declare something{}
                we are selecting the element wich names represent, in the exemple we will se the body being select and then stylished
                body{
                    background-color:pink
                    font-family:arial (any available font is used)
                        the font family propertie is enherited by childs element
                            the body element
                        all properties that are related to font are enherited
                }
                h1 {
                    font-size: 45px
                }
            to select a class (wich may have different elements) we use .class
                .class{
                    color:red
                }
            to select based on Id we use hastag (#name-of-the-Id)
            #ids-name{
                the bord is a shorthand propertie as makes possible to change different things
                border: width style color
                also the bord isn't enherited
            }
    
    box model in CSS
        its the main factor that defines how elements are displayed in the web-page and how they are sized
        content of the box
            its where all the text,images,content goes
            we can define its height and width using the corresponding css properties
        the paddin is a trasparent area arouind the content inside the box
            create white space inside the box
            we can define using the padding propertie in css
        we can specify the border
            goes around the padding and the content
        the margin
            white space between boxes
            if we want to creat space between to things we simply need to use the margin propertie 
        the fill area
            area that gets filled witch background color/image
            dont includes the margin
        we need to reset all of the margins/padding/elements before doing anything
            select all of this with the star(*) selector
            *{
                margin: value
                padding: value
                box-sizing:border-box 
                    this will include padding and borders into the widthor the height that we specify for an element
            }  
        child selector
            will be used in Js to selec styles while using DOM manipulation
            #nome-of-id name-of-the-other-selector {
                color
            }
                #your-name h2{
                    color: white
                }
        for img, if theres only one, we can use the img selector 
            but if it has more than one, we will use the Id/class of it
            #name-of-image-id{
                width: valuepx
                its easier to specify the width
            }
