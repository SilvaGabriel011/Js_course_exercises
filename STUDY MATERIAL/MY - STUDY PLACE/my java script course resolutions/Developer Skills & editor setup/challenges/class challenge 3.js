/*
Let's say you're building a time tracking application for freelancers. At some point in building this app, you need a function that receives daily work hours for a certain week, and returns:
1. Total hours worked
2. Average daily hours
3. The day with the most hours worked
4. Number of days worked
5. Whether the week was full-time (worked 35 hours or more)

TEST DATA: [7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0]
