BUILD PROJECT WITH VISUAL USER INTERFACE

GUESS MY NUMBER PROJECT
    IT WILL NEED
        CSS FILE
        HTML FILE
        JAVASCRIPT FILE
    All of the interface is implemented in html 
    document.querySelector('.message')
        first select the ELEMENT
            .textContent)
                property 
    we will make js interact with a web page

        DOM MANIPULATION
            document object model
                structured representation of html documents
                allows js to acces html elements and styles to manipulate them 
                we will be able to change
                    text
                    atributes
                    style - CSS
            basicaly a conexion point between html doc and js codes
            in the tree each html element is an object
            Document
            └── <html> (first child)
                ├── <head> (siblings)
                │   └── <title>
                │       └── "Minha Página"
                └── <body> (siblings)
                    ├── <h1>
                    │   └── "Título Principal"
                    ├── <p>
                    │   └── "Parágrafo de exemplo."
                    └── <ul>
                        ├── <li>
                        │   └── "Item 1"
                        ├── <li>
                        │   └── "Item 2"
                        └── <li>
                            └── "Item 3"
            for each element in html there is one element node in the DOM tree
                to acces and interact with this nodes we use JS 
                the dom always starts with the document object
                    document is a special object that we have acess in js 
                        the entry point
                    we need it to start selectin elements
            the first child element is usually HTML element
            whatever is in the HTML DOCUMENT HAS TO BE IN THE DOM
                so the dom is a complet representation of the html document
            the dom its not part of the JS language
                the dom and dom methods are acctually part of web API'S
            THE WEB API'S (application programing interfaces)
                are like libraries that browsers implement 
                    we can acces from Js code
            
    selecting and manipulating elements
        document.querySelector('.message').textContent = 'Correct number !!'
        changing the value of an element
        we need the html to get all of the class names that has values for this PROJECT
        in an input field to get the actual value we use
            document.querySelector('.element').value
    
    handling click events
        the code will reacts to something that happens in the dom
        for that we will need an event listener
            mouse click = event
            mouse moving = event
            key press = event
            with an event listener we can wait for a certain event to happen and react to it
        in order to listen to the event we should place a listener where the event could happen 
        so when we click on the button, somethin SHOULD HAPPEN 
        
        select the button element
        document.querySelector('.check')
        now the button needs the event listener method
            and as a method there are multipple ways to listen to events
            addEventListener("nameOfEvent",what should the event listener do)
                    what to do == function (its called eventHandler)
                        what should happens when the button is pressed
            real exemple:

            document.querySelector('.check').addEventListener('click', function () {
            console.log(document.querySelector('.guess').value);
                })
            the eventHandler function will only be called when the event happens
