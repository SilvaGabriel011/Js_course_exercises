    use console in the browser to do simple code in Js 

    to explicit that some value with name is a variable is used the LET
        let variable = 'something'

    definition of javascript
        high level
            managing the program memory isn't a worry
        object oriented
            based on objects for storing most kinds of data
        multi-paradigm
            instruct computer to DO THINGS
            works on imperative and instructive code
        
    the role of Js in web dev
        in the browser create front-end web app
        add dynamic and interactive effects
        build applications
        WITH NODE
            CAN CREATE WEB APPLICATIONS ON WEB SERVERS
            BEACK-END APPLICATIONS

    we can have in line scripts, but the only advantage are that it dosen't requires a propper Js file to store it
        but its bad for separe content - hmtl/css
        from logic - Js

    PUT THE SCR = 'SCRIPT.JS' IN THE BELOW PART OF THE BODY

    value = piece of data
        it needs to be stored in somewhere
        can be
            constants = const 
            variables = let

    convention and rules to name variables  
        camelCase
        cant put number first on a variable
            1thisIsNotAVariable
                thisIs
        avoid reserved key words
        make variables name descriptive 
        variable = box that can sotre a value
    
    data types
        every value in Js is 
        object
        primitive
            number
            boolean
            string 
            Null
            Undefined
            Symbol 
            bigint 
        Js is dynamic typed, it dosent need to say what type is the data used on the code
        typeof(data) 
            return the data type

    code comenting
        // coment code after the double slash
        /* to create
            multi line of comented code */
    OBS:
    when declaring variabel it need to use the let/const
        after, if reasign value it dosent need the let keyword
