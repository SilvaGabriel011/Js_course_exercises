    use console in the browser to do simple code in Js 

    to explicit that some value with name is a variable is used the LET
        let variable = 'something'

    definition of javascript
        high level
            managing the program memory isn't a worry
        object oriented
            based on objects for storing most kinds of data
        multi-paradigm
            instruct computer to DO THINGS
            works on imperative and instructive code
        
    the role of Js in web dev
        in the browser create front-end web app
        add dynamic and interactive effects
        build applications
        WITH NODE
            CAN CREATE WEB APPLICATIONS ON WEB SERVERS
            BEACK-END APPLICATIONS

    we can have in line scripts, but the only advantage are that it dosen't requires a propper Js file to store it
        but its bad for separe content - hmtl/css
        from logic - Js

    PUT THE SCR = 'SCRIPT.JS' IN THE BELOW PART OF THE BODY

    value = piece of data
        it needs to be stored in somewhere
        can be
            constants = const 
            variables = let

    convention and rules to name variables  
        camelCase
        cant put number first on a variable
            1thisIsNotAVariable
                thisIs
        avoid reserved key words
        make variables name descriptive 
        variable = box that can sotre a value
    
    data types
        every value in Js is 
        object
        primitive
            number
            boolean
            string 
            Null
            Undefined
            Symbol 
            bigint 
        Js is dynamic typed, it dosent need to say what type is the data used on the code
        typeof(data) 
            return the data type

    code comenting
        // coment code after the double slash
        /* to create
            multi line of comented code */

    declaring variables
        let
            variables that can have the value changed 
            reassing/mutate value for the value
            *BLOCK SCOPE*
        var
            SHOULD BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED
            USED IN LEGACY CODE
            *FUNCTION SCOPE*
        const
            creates a variable that its imutable/cannot be reassing 
            cannot creat empty const variables 
            it needs initial variables 
        use const by default but if the variable is getting change somewhere in the code, use let 
        OBS:
        when declaring variabel it need to use the let/const
            after, if reasign value it dosent need the let keyword
            but always declare a variable at first 

    operators
        all *mathematical operations* can be used in Js 
            + add (can be use to concatonate stings aswell)
            - subtract
            * multiply
            / divide
            %% (module, that is the rest of the division)
            ** (to the power)
            += (a = a + some value, so if += 1 then, a = a + 1)
            *= (a = a * some value, so if *= 1 then, a = a * 1)
            ++ (a = a + 1, add one value to the variable or anything like that...)
            -- (a = a - 1, subtract one value to the variable or anything like that....)
        comparison operators, all of them return a boolean value
            > (graterthan)
            < (less than)
            >= (grater or equal)
            <= (less or equal)
    
    operators precedence
        available at mdn mozilla precedence operators
        usually all the math operators are triggered before the logical/boolean/assignment operators
        assignment is done right to left allways
        grouping has high precedence
    
    strings and template literals
        insert the variable inside the string 
        ` use back ticks and write the string, and use para adicionar a ${variavel}`
            inside the curly braces can be put a calculation 
            can be used all time as traditional indicator of a string, instead of the '' or ""
        \n\ represents there's a new line betwen the content 
            for template literals can just use a enter betwen the content

    control strcuture:
        conditional *if/else statements*
            condition a is true?
            
                if yes, execute this block of code
                    block of condition === true
                if no
                    block of condition === false

                ****inside the paranthesis will be a code that returns a boolean value****
                
            if (value is true?){
                execute this block of code
            }    
            else if (value true instead){
                execute this other block of code
            }
            else *execluding all of values,doesen't need a boolean value here* {
                execute this block of code
            }

            EX.: FOR NOTATIONS....
                if (!isMarkHigherBmi) {
                    console.log(`johns's BMI ${bmiJohn} is higher than mark's ${bmiMark}!`);
                }
                else {
                    console.log(`Mark's BMI ${bmiMark} is higher than John's ${bmiJohn}!`);
                };

    type conversion/coercion
        javascript have both 
            coercion = automatically converts the type of the data
            number(value) = forces the string to be a number    
                built in function 
                works only if the value is a string of numbers
                    if used in characters will return NaN
            string(value) = forces the number to be a string
                built in function 
                work only if the value is a number
            can only convert
                to a number
                to a string
                to a boolean
        in many situations js just coert the data to what it jugdes its best 
        minus/multiplier/dividing operators makees strings become numbers
        add operator make number become string 

    truthy and falsie values
        falsy values
            0
            empty string
            Undefined
            Null
            NaN
        boolean(value)
            built in function that's return's true/false
            based on falsy/truthy values 
        in logical context evaluation Js will search for the truthy/falsy values
        if (truthy/!falsy){do this....;}
            the parenthesis is a logical enviroment

    equality operators == x ===
        '18' == 18 returns true
            but '18' === 18 returns false 
        it needs to have both value and type of data to be triple equal 
        strict equality comparison (===)
            it only returns true if both of values has equal, DOES NOT PERFORMS TYPE COERCION
                type
                data
            BETTER FOR CLEAN CODE 
        loose equality (==)
            does type coercion, so
                18 == '18' returns true 
            Can cause hard to find bugs 

    user input === **const storeString = prompt("store some data")**
        it will be stored as string
        **const sotreNumber(prompt("store a value that will be stored as number))**
    !== state diference between datas
        !true returns false
    

    boolean logic --- and, or, not
    
        *AND* TRUTH TABLE
        it needs both values to be true, to return true
        true a AND true b === true
        false a AND true b === false
        true a AND false b === false
        false a AND false b === false

        *OR* TRURH TABLE
        it only needs one variable to be true to return true
        true a OR true b === true
        false a OR True b === true
        true a OR false b === true
        false a OR false b === false 
        
        NOT === inverts the boolean value
        ****HAS MORE PRECEDENCE, SO VALUES ARE INVERTED BEFORE COMPARING FOR LOGICAL OPERATIONS****
        !true == return false
        !false = return true
