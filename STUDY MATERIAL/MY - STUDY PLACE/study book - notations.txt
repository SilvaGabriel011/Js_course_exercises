    use console in the browser to do simple code in Js 

    to explicit that some value with name is a variable is used the LET
        let variable = 'something'

    definition of javascript
        high level
            managing the program memory isn't a worry
        object oriented
            based on objects for storing most kinds of data
        multi-paradigm
            instruct computer to DO THINGS
            works on imperative and instructive code
        
    the role of Js in web dev
        in the browser create front-end web app
        add dynamic and interactive effects
        build applications
        WITH NODE
            CAN CREATE WEB APPLICATIONS ON WEB SERVERS
            BEACK-END APPLICATIONS

    we can have in line scripts, but the only advantage are that it dosen't requires a propper Js file to store it
        but its bad for separe content - hmtl/css
        from logic - Js

    PUT THE SCR = 'SCRIPT.JS' IN THE BELOW PART OF THE BODY

    value = piece of data
        it needs to be stored in somewhere
        can be
            constants = const 
            variables = let

    convention and rules to name variables  
        camelCase
        cant put number first on a variable
            1thisIsNotAVariable
                thisIs
        avoid reserved key words
        make variables name descriptive 
        variable = box that can sotre a value
    
    data types
        every value in Js is 
        object
        primitive
            number
            boolean
            string 
            Null
            Undefined
            Symbol 
            bigint 
        Js is dynamic typed, it dosent need to say what type is the data used on the code
        typeof(data) 
            return the data type

    code comenting
        // coment code after the double slash
        /* to create
            multi line of comented code */

    declaring variables
        let
            variables that can have the value changed 
            reassing/mutate value for the value
            *BLOCK SCOPE*
        var
            SHOULD BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED
            USED IN LEGACY CODE
            *FUNCTION SCOPE*
        const
            creates a variable that its imutable/cannot be reassing 
            cannot creat empty const variables 
            it needs initial variables 
        use const by default but if the variable is getting change somewhere in the code, use let 
        OBS:
        when declaring variabel it need to use the let/const
            after, if reasign value it dosent need the let keyword
            but always declare a variable at first 

    operators
        all *mathematical operations* can be used in Js 
            + add (can be use to concatonate stings aswell)
            - subtract
            * multiply
            / divide
            %% (module, that is the rest of the division)
            ** (to the power)
            += (a = a + some value, so if += 1 then, a = a + 1)
            *= (a = a * some value, so if *= 1 then, a = a * 1)
            ++ (a = a + 1, add one value to the variable or anything like that...)
            -- (a = a - 1, subtract one value to the variable or anything like that....)
        comparison operators, all of them return a boolean value
            > (graterthan)
            < (less than)
            >= (grater or equal)
            <= (less or equal)
    
    operators precedence
        available at mdn mozilla precedence operators
        usually all the math operators are triggered before the logical/boolean/assignment operators
        assignment is done right to left allways
        grouping has high precedence
    
    strings and template literals
        insert the variable inside the string 
        ` use back ticks and write the string, and use para adicionar a ${variavel}`
            inside the curly braces can be put a calculation 
            can be used all time as traditional indicator of a string, instead of the '' or ""
        \n\ represents there's a new line betwen the content 
            for template literals can just use a enter betwen the content
    
    conditional *if/else statements*
